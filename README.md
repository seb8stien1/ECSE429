## Project A

The first part consisted of Exploratory Testing the API. The contents of which can be found [here](https://github.com/seb8stien1/ECSE429-A1/tree/main/Exploratory%20Testing).

The second part consisted of writing unit tests which can be found [here](https://github.com/seb8stien1/ECSE429/tree/main/src/test/java/tests/unitTests).

The third part consisted of filming a video of the unit tests suite running, the video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm5irLbheT8&ab_channel=RooshnieVelautham).
